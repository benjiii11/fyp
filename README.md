            This is a game of hangman with a twist â€” where there is a timer instead of lives like in traditional hangman.
            The zombies have invaded, and they will slowly eat you up unless you solve the word in time.

          <Text style={styles.instructionText}>
            The real challenge is here! For every wrong guess, the zombie will leap toward you. For every correct guess,
            you will knock the zombie back a little. Be warned: the words get tougher the longer you survive.

          <Text style={styles.instructionText}>
            A zombie is coming for your brains! Solve the hidden word before it reaches you. Press any letter on the on-screen
            keyboard to guess. When the full word is revealed, your cowboy will shoot the zombie down and reset the challenge.
