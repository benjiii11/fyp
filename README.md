            This is a game of hangman with a twist â€” where there is a timer instead of lives like in traditional hangman.
                    
            The zombies have invaded, and they will slowly eat you up unless you solve the word in time.
       

         
            There are different modes where you can challenge yourself to beat your high score:
         

         Practice Mode:
          
            Easy, Normal, and Hard modes are for practice. The zombie will slowly make its way toward your brains!
         

         Challenge Mode:
         
            The real challenge is here! For every wrong guess, the zombie will leap toward you. For every correct guess,
            you will knock the zombie back a little. Be warned: the words get tougher the longer you survive.
     

        How to Play:
          
            A zombie is coming for your brains! Solve the hidden word before it reaches you. Press any letter on the on-screen
            keyboard to guess. When the full word is revealed, your cowboy will shoot the zombie down and reset the challenge.
         

          Challenge Mechanics :
          
            For each wrong guesses, the zombie will leap towards you! For each right guesses, you will be able to knock the zombie back!
      

         Good luck, and defend your brains!
